# Crypto-currency-price-prediction
The code is built to predict the crypto-currency prices of Bitcoin, Cardano and Ethereum based on the traffic on searches on these crypto-currencies on Google.

## Code Description
- Since the trends obtained from Google are at a monthly granularity, daily_data.ipynb is used to pre-process the data at a day granularity.
- The train.ipynb file helps in training and obtaining predictions for crypto-currency prices.
